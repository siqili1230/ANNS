% This sample program shows how to use the sample implementation of IVFADC variant 
% of the quantization based approximate nearest neighbor search method described 
% in "Product quantization for nearest neighbor search"
%
% This matlab implementation is not as efficient as the C/python one we used 
% in our paper (especially for small datasets, due to the fixed overhead of the method).
% Another restriction is that it is limited to 8 bits/subquantizer
% However it provides same accuracy and same memory usage for this parameter.
