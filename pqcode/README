What is this?
=============

A (slow) matlab implementation of the product quantizer search method.
This library allows the search in a large vector dataset indexed by a 
limited amount of memory. It is an implementation of the method described in

INRIA might also provide an optimized C/python implementation of this library,

Installation
============

1) Download the yael library and compile the matlab function (matlab subdirectory). 
See https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/yael/

The pqcodes package was tested with version Yael v138. 

Note this library is maintained only for Linux. A windows implementation is also 
provided in release v42, but this is not supported by the main developpers. 

2) Put the subdirectory "matlab" of Matlab in the matlab path (done by the "addpath" Matlab command)

3) Compile the mexfile for better efficiency:
>> mex sumidxtab.c

4) Optionnally, download the siftsmall/sift/gist evaluation datasets for tests on real data

5) run the pq_test or the ivfpq_test sample programs

Remark: by default, the program uses an automatically generated dataset ('random'). 
        You can download the same datasets as the one we used in our paper [JDS11]
        at the following address: http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr
        In that case, you have to adjust the "basedir" variable in the file
        pq_test_load_Vectors.m to fit your local path
