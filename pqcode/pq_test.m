% This sample program shows how to use the sample implementation of ADC variant 
% of the quantization based approximate nearest neighbor search method described 
% in "Product quantization for nearest neighbor search"
%
% This matlab implementation is not as efficient as the C/python one we used 
% in our paper, though it provides similar accuracy for the same memory usage. 
% Another restriction is that it is limited to 8 bits/subquantizer
